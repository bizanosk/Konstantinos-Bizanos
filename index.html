            <h2>Diogenes the Cynic Philosopher</h2>
            <p>
                The word “cynic” (in Greek kynikos, or κυνικός, meaning “dog-like”), derives from the word κύων, or kynos, meaning ‘dog’ and was used to describe the dog-like behavior of Diogenes, who lived in the streets, sometimes eating raw meat and performing his natural bodily functions in public much like a dog.
            </p>
            <p>
                Despite his eccentricities, Diogenes was a sage philosopher. His observations about life, politics, and society were amazingly spot-on although they were often expressed in offensive language.
            </p>
            <p>
                Diogenes famously cared little about the opinions of others and did not care if the person standing before him was a king or a slave; he would treat everyone the same —poorly.
            </p>
            <p>
                When his strange lifestyle and wise beliefs became known across Greece, people from around the ancient world traveled to meet the philosopher in person, either out of respect or curiosity.
            </p>
            <h3>Alexander the Great meets Diogenes</h3>
            <p>
                Alexander the Great, the famed Greek leader who spread Hellenism across the world, was an admirer of Diogenes. A student of ancient philosopher and scientist Aristotle, Alexander had a great respect for wise men like Diogenes, so he decided to meet the philosopher for himself.
            </p>
            <p>
                He traveled to Corinth, where Diogenes was living at the time. Based on the accounts of Plutarch, the two men exchanged only a few words. Alexander came upon Diogenes as the philosopher was basking in the morning sunlight.
            </p>
            <p>
                Thrilled to meet the famous thinker, Alexander asked if there was any favor he might do for him. To that, Diogenes replied:
            </p>
            <p>
                “Move a little to the right; you are blocking my sun.”
            </p>
            <p>
                Alexander then declared, “If I were not Alexander, then I should wish to be Diogenes.” This famous anecdote is known across the world.
            </p>
