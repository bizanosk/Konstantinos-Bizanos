            <h2>Work Experience</h2>
            <p>
                <b>High School Mathematics Tutor:</b> Over the past 6 years, I have taught mathematics to students across various age groups and topics.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>University-Level Tutor:</b> For the past 3 years, I have provided academic tutoring in subjects such as Linear Algebra, Ordinary Differential Equations, Real Analysis (Metric Topology), Abstract Algebra, Differential Topology of Curves and Surfaces, and Probability Theory. Additionally, I have tutored students from external universities, including courses like Mathematical Analysis and Analytic Geometry for students at the National and Technical University of Athens. Currently, I am offering tutoring in Representation Theory of Finite Groups and Ordinary Differential Equations.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Author:</b> I am co-authoring a book on the Differential Geometry of Curves and Surfaces in collaboration with the tutoring center SupM.
            </p>
            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>
                <b>Bachelor's Degree in Mathematics:</b> National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, with an average grade of 9.46/10.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>Master's Degree in Pure Mathematics:</b> Currently pursuing at the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens, with an average grade of 9.7/10. My thesis, titled "Every module has flat cover," is supervised by Professor Ioannis Emmanouil.
            </p>
            <h2>Volunteering</h2>
            <p> Since my second year as an undergraduate, I have been volunteering in the Department of Mathematics, contributing to various activities. Together with Tasos Fragkos, Ioannis Oikonomidis, and Vaggelis Katsadonis, I co-organized the "Mathematics Group," a series of weekly events where both undergraduate and graduate students present topics spanning a wide range of mathematical disciplines. These events are held in collaboration with the University of Athens.

                Currently, alongside several colleagues, I am working on establishing a radio station for the Department of Mathematics. Our goal is to use it regularly for important departmental announcements and to host weekly radio shows.</p>
            <h3>Mathematics Workshops</h3>
            <p>I have actively participated in organizing and assisting mathematics workshops for undergraduate students at the University of Athens. These workshops aimed to enhance students' understanding of complex mathematical concepts through interactive sessions and collaborative problem-solving.</p>
            
            <h3>Mentorship Program</h3>
            <p>As part of the university's mentorship program, I have mentored first-year students, helping them adjust to university life and providing academic guidance in their initial mathematics courses. This involvement also included contributing to the development of educational materials tailored for new students.</p>
            
            <h3>Lecture Notes and Exam Papers Collection</h3>
            <p>I am a member of a volunteering group at the University of Athens that collects lecture notes and examination papers for every year, helping students prepare and study more effectively. Here are some of the resources we've gathered:</p>
